## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ’¬ Hi, I'm Aleks! I love programming because it offers endless opportunities to learn and grow.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a C++ Star Game Strategy project and a Flutter Budget App for my phone.
âš¡ Fun fact: I studied C# in school, but explored Python during my free time. Now, I'm diving into C++ and other exciting journeys!
